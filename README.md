## How to Run Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/Dileep-025/TrackNest.git
    cd "TrackNest"
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html`**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or by right-clicking and choosing "Open with..." your browser.

3.  **Using a Local Server (Recommended)**:
    For a better development experience and to avoid potential browser security restrictions (e.g., for local file access), it's recommended to serve the files using a local web server. If you have Node.js installed, you can use `http-server`:

    a. **Install `http-server` globally (if you haven't already)**:
    `bash
    npm install -g http-server
    `

    b. **Navigate to the project directory and start the server**:
    `bash
    cd "D:/VS Code/TrackNest/"
    http-server -c-1
    `

    c. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port indicated by `http-server`).

Enjoy tracking your finances with TrackNest!
