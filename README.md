3.  **Using a Local Server (Recommended)**:
    For a better development experience and to avoid potential browser security restrictions (e.g., for local file access), it's recommended to serve the files using a local web server. If you have Node.js installed, you can use `http-server`:

    a. **Install `http-server` globally (if you haven't already)**:
    `bash
npm install -g http-server
`

    b. **Navigate to the project directory and start the server**:
    `bash
cd "D:/VS Code/Personal Finance Trecker/"
http-server -c-1
`

    c. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port indicated by `http-server`).

Enjoy tracking your finances with TrackNest!
